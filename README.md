# Queue and Dequeue Implementation

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of Queue and Dequeue data structures in C++. These structures are fundamental in computer science for managing data efficiently.

## Features
- Implementation of Queue: FIFO (First In First Out) structure.
- Implementation of Dequeue: Double-ended queue allowing insertion and deletion at both ends.
- Example scenarios demonstrating their usage.

## Technologies
- C++

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/TaqiRaza512/Queue_Dequeue.git

2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.

## Usage
- Include the Queue and Dequeue classes in your C++ projects.
- Use these data structures for managing data in a FIFO or double-ended manner.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the functionality or improve the codebase are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
